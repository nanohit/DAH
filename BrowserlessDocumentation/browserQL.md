# BrowserQL

BrowserQL (BQL) is a revolutionary GraphQL-based browser automation API that redefines how web automation is done. Built for the modern web and powered by Browserless's cloud-based infrastructure for running headless browsers at scale, BQL uses a minimal, scriptable query language specifically designed for stealth-first automation that bypasses even the most sophisticated bot detection systems.

This robust platform ensures your automation runs reliably with global endpoints, advanced proxy support, and enterprise-grade performance, while BQL's intuitive GraphQL syntax, powerful stealth capabilities, and integrated development environment let you move fast without sacrificing control or effectiveness. No more context switching, no complex setup - just powerful browser automation that works.

### Why Use BrowserQL?​

BrowserQL is the **best solution** when you need to:

- Bypass advanced bot detection systems.
- Automate CAPTCHA-solving flows.
- Mimic human-like interactions reliably.
- Build stealth-first automations at scale.

With decades of research and development behind it, BrowserQL is a production-grade solution designed to succeed where traditional browser automation fails.

### Key Features & Capabilities​

- Advanced Stealth Technology: Human-like interactions, CAPTCHA solving, and fingerprint masking that outperforms traditional automation tools
- GraphQL-Powered: Simple, declarative mutations for complex browser actions - no more wrestling with traditional automation code
- Fully-Featured Web IDE: Live session preview, built-in documentation, and zero-installation development environment
- Production-Ready: Decades of research and development behind a solution designed to succeed where others fail
- Seamless Integration: Export to any language or connect with existing Puppeteer/Playwright scripts

If you already have an automation library that works over WebSockets, you can mix-and-match BrowserQL with the library of your choice. To learn how to integrate BQL, check the guides below:

- Connecting with Puppeteer
- Connecting with Playwright

There's a lot more to BQL than just this. Our Editor comes with built-in documentation, a live Viewer and Devtools to get you started. Refer to the following pages to learn more about BQL:

- Mutation Reference

If you already have a Puppeteer script, our AI (which you can find at the top of this page - with the button Ask AI) does a great job of helping you to move from Puppeteer to BQL.
